 ### Data Set Priority
  
    1. **500 Cities Health** - This data set has more variability, and also provides us the option to either use the entire data set or a portion of it. The dataset is also not very complex but still requires some cleaning. Possible questions which we would answer is "Which states have more health issues grouped on health issue type ?"
    2. **Medicare Spending** - Since our 1st priority is data analysis on Health related data, we can combine this data set to extend our analysis. It would also lead to more questions being answered with respect to health data, such as "How much amount is spent state wise for health and medicare ? ", "Which state populations spend most on medicare ?
    3. **Indian Groundwater** 
    4. **Tobacco Use**
