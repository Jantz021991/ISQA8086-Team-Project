## Description of the data source with citation

It’s the complete dataset for the 500 Cities project,available from data.gov.It includes 2013, 2014 model-based small area estimates 
for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of
preventive services (9). It also includes estimates for approximately 28,000 census tracts within 
500 largest US cities. It includes 10 variables and 810103 observations that included:
* Year
* State
* Category
* Measure
* Data value Type
* Data Value,
* Low Confidence Limit
* High Confidence Limit
* Population Count
* Short Question Text.
    
    This dataset is significant to identity emerging health problems and provide information for disease
prevention activities.

The Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to allow users to freely

databases are covered by copyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some
jurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that cover databases, and so the
ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally, the ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of
this Database to act in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.

 Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual material, and
sounds all in the same database, for example), and so the ODbL only governs the rights over the
Database, and not the contents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL
together with another license for the contents, if the contents have a single set of rights that
uniformly covers all of the contents. If the contents have multiple sets of different rights,
Licensors should describe what rights govern what contents together in the individual record or
in some other way that clarifies what rights apply.

 Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered by other rights not
addressed here (such as private contracts, trade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data
protection rights over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may have to
consult other documents or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this License.

## Description of Metadata and Purpose of Project

1. This is the complete dataset for the 500 Cities project. This dataset includes 2013, 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. 

2. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities.

3. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2013, 2014), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2009-2013, 2010-2014 estimates. More information about the methodology can be found at www.cdc.gov/500cities.

**Purpose of the Project**
1. "This project reports city and census tract-level data, obtained using small area estimation methods, for 27 chronic disease measures for the 500 largest American cities.
2. The data are published through a public, interactive “500 Cities” website that allows users to view, explore, and download city- and tract-level data.
3. Although limited data are available at the county and metropolitan levels, this project represents a first-of-its kind data analysis to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within cities. This system complements existing surveillance data necessary to more fully understand the health issues affecting the residents of that city or census tract.

These high-quality, small-area epidemiologic data can be used both by individual cities and groups of cities as well as other stakeholders to help develop and implement effective and targeted prevention activities; identify emerging health problems; and establish and monitor key health objectives. For example, city planners and elected officials may want to use this data to target neighborhoods with high rates of smoking or other health risk behaviors for effective interventions."
