 This is an open database intended for public use. Open Database License(ODbL). The details of its usage and availability are as follows:

    The Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to allow users to freely

The Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to allow users to freely
share, modify, and use this Database while maintaining this same freedom for others. Many
databases are covered by copyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some
jurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that cover databases, and so the
ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally, the ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of
this Database to act in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.

    Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual material, and
sounds all in the same database, for example), and so the ODbL only governs the rights over the
Database, and not the contents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL
together with another license for the contents, if the contents have a single set of rights that
uniformly covers all of the contents. If the contents have multiple sets of different rights,
Licensors should describe what rights govern what contents together in the individual record or
in some other way that clarifies what rights apply.

    Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered by other rights not
addressed here (such as private contracts, trade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data
protection rights over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may have to
consult other documents or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this License.
