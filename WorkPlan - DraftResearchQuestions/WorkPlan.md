_This markdown document explains the dataset analysis - **500 Cities: Local Data for Better Health** with respect to research questions, planned timeline of project, projected effort allocation and target audience._

## Research Questions

>Mentioned below are the draft research questions we plan to answer based on our data cleaning and analysis over the course of this project.

  1. What is the estimate of existence of _Unhealthy behavior, Health outcomes and Preventive services_, based on different measures in each of the states in the US ?

  2. What is the health level or health risk factor of one state compared to another ? Which states have a higher health risk level and which states are at a lower health risk level ?

  3. Which health problem is most prominent and prevailing for each state in each category (_Unhealthy behavior, Health outcomes and Preventive services_) ?

  4. What could be the key health objectives and preventive measures required for each state based on the health problems ?

>Our team plans to start off by trying to answer the four questions specified above. If there are further questions which could be extended from our analysis and answered, those will be updated accordingly. So the number of questions are subject to change.

* This includes the tasks identification, the respective time for completion and the duration of the entire project made through Projectlibre software.The above mentioned file is available in the pdf as well as pod format available [here](https://github.com/Narahari-Sundaragopalan/ISQA8086-TeamProject/blob/master/WorkPlan%20-%20DraftResearchQuestions/ProjectWorkPlan_DTDFinal.pod).

* The planned timeline of the project duration includes *09/18/2017 - 12/6/2017* which is **71.75 days ~ 72 days**.

* The project plan and the duration includes the tasks that are required in the project workdown procedure and the corresponding tasks which are dependent on each one.

>Note: I have considered 5-day work week with each task allocated for 7 hours a day.

## Projected effort allocation












## Target audience
* Researcher: The result report gives researchers an research direction, so they know which disease is common and should have more researches on.
* Government Agents: The result report will help government agents target their job on public health prevention activities.
* Hospital/Physician: From the result report, hospital or doctor could have early preparation for the current and potential patients.
